# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline built on the classic **Kaggle Titanic dataset**.  
The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on demographic and travel-related features.

This project was developed as a **learning-focused yet professional ML workflow**, covering the full process from raw data to model ensemble and Kaggle submission.

## 📌 Project Overview

The pipeline includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Missing value analysis and handling
- Feature engineering
- Categorical encoding
- Train / validation split
- Multiple model training
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Ensemble learning (Voting Classifier)
- Kaggle-ready submission file generation

---

## 🧠 Models Used

The following machine learning models were implemented and compared:

- Logistic Regression (baseline model)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Ensemble Model (Soft Voting Classifier)

Model selection was performed using **Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation** and **accuracy** as the evaluation metric.

## 🧪 Evaluation Strategy

- Train / validation split
- Stratified 10-Fold Cross Validation
- Hyperparameter optimization via GridSearchCV
- Comparison of individual models and ensemble performance
